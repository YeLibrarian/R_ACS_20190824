## Welcome
- Restrooms
- Wireless internet connection
- Pre-workshop survey
- Please accept the invitation from RStudio Cloud and create an account if you have not
- Open group note-taking

## Agenda


## Introduce yourself
- Your name
- Why are you interested in this workshop
- Anything else you'd like to share with the group

## There Are No Stupid Questions! {#questions}
- Post sticky notes to the back of your laptop to signal the instructors and helpers

Hot pinky note means stop                    Blue note means go

## NASEM Consensus Report defined Reproduciblity as Computational Reproducibility | May 2019 {#report}

<div class="columns-2">
- **Reproducibility**: Obtaining consistent results using the **same input data, computational steps, methods and conditions of analysis**
- **Replicability**: Obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the **same scientific question**, each of which has **obtained its own data**

 https://doi.org/10.17226/25303 .

## Computational Reproducibility 
All the components below are required to reproduce the research publication

The practice of distributing
--------------------------------------------  ------   
All data 
Software source codes or scripts for analysis
Tools (and the computing environment needed)


## Automated and open workflow is good for reproducibility {#logos}

Open Tools                         What is it?
--------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------
![](images/RLogo.png)              Programming language and the software that interprets the scripts 
![](images/RStudioLogo.png)        Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Popular way to write R scripts and interact with the R software
![](images/RStudioCloudLogo.png)   A managed cloud instance of RStudio. Good for teaching and learning

## RStudio / RStudio Cloud Interface {#interface}
- All info needed to write code in a single window
- Shortcuts, autocompletion, and highlighting for the major file types

## Project management in R | Create a self-contained project folder including a set of related data, analyses, and text that organized in subfolders
- It remembers working directory and custom settings
- Steps in **RStudio**:
  - 'File' menu --> click on 'New Project'. 
  - Choose 'Existing Directory', then browse to the folder where you downloaded workshop data files.
  - Click on 'Create Project'. An ' .Rproj' file is added to the project folder.  
- Steps in **RStudio Cloud** 
  - Click on **'Start'** in front of the project "Student In-Class Practice"
  - An R Project has been created for you there.

## Project management in R | Include a set of related data, analyses, and text that organized in subfolders
- **'data/'**: use this folder to store your raw data and intermediate datasets you may create 
  - Always keep a copy of your raw data 
  - do as much of your data cleanup and preprocessing with scripts
- **'scripts/'**: use this folder for your R scripts for different analyses or plotting
- **'figures/'**: use this folder to save figures you plot using scripts
- **'data_output/'**: use this folder to save data files you obtained using scripts
- **'documents/'**: use this folder for your outlines, drafts, and other texts
- Practice: in **RStudio Cloud** / Student In-Class Practices
  - Use 'New Folder' button in the right bottom Files section to create a solder called 'documents'
 

## Project management in R | Working directory
- **Working directory**: the place from where R will be looking for and saving the files
- RStudio will now set your **working directory** as the folder where your xxx.Rproj file lives
- Practice: in **RStudio Cloud** / Student In-Class Practices
  - Open scripts/RBasicsPractice.R
  - At line 6, typing "getwd()" and run it to identify the current working directory

## Basic R commands | We will now use **RStudio Cloud** / Student In-Class Practices to learn: 
- Use R as a calculator
- Assign value to a variable in the Environment
- Remove variables from the Environment
- Get tabulized data into the Environment as data frames
- 

## Getting Help



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

## Slide with Bullets

- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Bullet 3

## Slide with R Output

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
